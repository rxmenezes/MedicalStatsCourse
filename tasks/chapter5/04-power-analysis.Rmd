### Quick tasks

1. Consider again the leukemia data, for which a Cox model was fitted to understand how `ag` and `log(wbc)` affect prognosis. Compute the sample size required to find the same effect size for `ag` as in this data, using a significance level of $\alpha=0.005$.

```{r}
leuk.cox <- coxph(Surv(time) ~ ag + log(wbc), data = leuk)
# Check the coefficients
leuk.cox$coefficients
# We would like to extract the first element of this vector
b1 <- leuk.cox$coefficients[1]
p.event <- 1 # all have an event
p1 <- mean(leuk$ag == "present")
get.ssize.surv(beta = 0.8, alpha = 0.005, p1 = p1, b1 = b1, pevents = p.event)
```
