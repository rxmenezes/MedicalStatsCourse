### Quick tasks

Let us go back to the `decathlon2` dataset. Use both histograms and boxplots to represent the distribution of the variable `Points` overall and by competitions.

```{r}
hist(decathlon2$Points, prob = TRUE)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(decathlon2$Points[decathlon2$Competition == 'Decastar'], xlab= 'Total Points', main = 'Histogram Total points at Decastar')
hist(decathlon2$Points[decathlon2$Competition == 'OlympicG'], xlab= 'Total Points', main = 'Histogram Total points at Olympic Games')
boxplot(decathlon2$Points)
boxplot(decathlon2$Points ~ decathlon2$Competition)
```
