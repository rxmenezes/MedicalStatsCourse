# Data types, part 1

## Basic data types (cont.) 

### Missing values

Numeric, character, logical vectors, factors might contain elements marked as 'missing'.

`NA` is a constant which indicates a missing value.

`NA` values would appear in the course materials and tasks.

### Numeric vectors 

There are several ways to construct a vector of numbers.

#### Single number (numeric vector with a single element)

```{r}

7
```

#### Multiple numbers

```{r}
c( 5, -2.5, NA, 7+3, 1/3 )
```

#### Sequence of numbers (one by one)

```{r}
3:17
```

#### Sequence of numbers

Sequence of numbers with a defined step:
```{r}
seq( 5, 15, 2 )
```

#### Combine (several) vectors of numbers

Multiple vectors can be combined together:
```{r}
v <- 1:9
w <- seq( 10, 90, 10 )
c( 0, v, w, 100 )
```

```{r results="asis", echo=FALSE, comment=""}
catLinkTaskSection( "numeric", "01_basic_data_types_cont.Rmd" );
```


### Character vectors 

There are several ways to construct a vector of texts.

#### Simple single text (character vector with a single element)

With double quotes:
```{r}
"Bioinformatics"
```

Or, with single quotes:
```{r}
'Biostatistics'
```

#### Multiple texts

```{r}
c( "Bioinformatics", "Biostatistics" )
```



### Logical vectors 

#### Elementary logical values

```{r}
TRUE
FALSE
T
F
c( FALSE, F, TRUE, T )    # vector of logical values
```

(*) `NA` is a logical constant and it gets automatically converted to other types when necessary.

#### Logical operators

##### Negation

Unary negation operator (denoted `!`):
```{r}
!TRUE
!FALSE
```

##### AND Operator `&`

Binary operator AND (denoted `&`) returns `TRUE` result when `all` its arguments are `TRUE`:
```{r}
TRUE & TRUE
```

Otherwise returns `FALSE`:
```{r}
FALSE & TRUE
FALSE & FALSE
```

##### OR operator `|`

Binary operator OR (denoted `|`) returns `TRUE` result when `any` (at least one) of its arguments is `TRUE`:
```{r}
TRUE | TRUE
FALSE | TRUE
```

Otherwise returns `FALSE`:
```{r}
FALSE | FALSE
```

#### Relational operators

##### Equality operator `==`

```{r}
1 == 2
"Bioinformatics" == "Biostatistics"
FALSE == F
```

##### Inequality operators 

```{r}
1 != 2    # unequal  
"a" != "A"
FALSE != T
1 < 2     # less than
1 > 2     # greater than
2 <= 2    # less or equal 
2 >= 2    # greater or equal
```

#### Comparison of two vectors

```{r}
v <- c( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 )
w <- c( 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 )
v == w
v != w
v < w
v <= w
v >= w
```

```{r results="asis", echo=FALSE, comment=""}
catLinkTaskSection( "logical", "01_basic_data_types_cont.Rmd" );
```

### Type conversions 

Sometimes a conversion to a vector of certain type might be needed.
The family of functions: `as.numeric`, `as.character`, `as.logical` take as an argument a vector of any type and return a vector of the type given in the function name.
When the conversion of an element is not possible, `NA` value is used.

```{r}
v <- 101:110
v
as.character( v )
```

```{r results="asis", echo=FALSE, comment=""}
catLinkTaskSection( "conversions", "01_basic_data_types_cont.Rmd" );
```


## Vectors

Vectors are data structures which are able to store multiple elements in a defined order.

There are several ways to access (single/multiple) elements from vectors which are discussed below.

### Square brackets operator

#### By numbers

Vector elements are kept at successive, numbered (indexed) positions. 
R vectors keep the first element at index 1 and the last element at index which can be obtained with the function `length`.

The indices can be used to fetch elements from the corresponding positions with the square bracket operators `[ pos ]`.

Let's take a vector:
```{r}
v <- 101:110
```

To get the first element of `v`:
```{r}
v[1]
```

To get the last element of `v`:
```{r}
v[ length( v ) ]
```

To get an element at a given index:
```{r}
v[ 5 ]
```

Setting a single element:
```{r}
v
v[ 2 ] <- 22
v
```

Getting multiple elements:
```{r}
v[ c( 2,4,7 ) ]
```

Setting multiple elements:
```{r}
v[ c( 2,4,7 ) ] <- c( 22, 24, 27 )
v
```

#### By names

Elements of the vectors can also be given names, i.e. `named vector`. Let's take a vector:
```{r}
v <- 101:110
v
```

Setting names of vector elements:
```{r}
names( v ) <- LETTERS[ 1:length( v ) ]
v
```

Getting names of vector elements:
```{r}
names( v )
```

Accessing elements (single or multiple) by names:
```{r}
v[ "C" ]
v[ c( "F", "H" ) ]
```

#### By condition (logical indices)

We can use a logical vector to select elements of a vector. Consider the vector

```{r}
b <- c(5, 7)
```

and say that we want to select the second element, but not the first. For this we know we can use

```{r}
b[2]
```

and it turns out we can also use a logical vector with `TRUE` for the element to be selected, and `FALSE` for the one not to be selected. That is `b[ c(FALSE, TRUE) ]` gives the same selection as above:

```{r}
b[ c(FALSE, TRUE) ]
```

This example is trivial. Let us take a longer vector:

```{r}
v <- 101:110
v
```

Now let us construct a logical vector `idx` with the same number of elements as `v`:

```{r}
idx <- c( F, F, F, T, F, T, F, F, T, NA )
```

`v` can now be "filtered through" `idx`, where positions in `idx` are selected or not according to:

  - `TRUE` in `idx`, then the element appears in the result;
  - `FALSE` in `idx`, then the element is skipped;
  - `NA` in `idx`, then the element is substituted with `NA` in the result.
  
This means that `NA` entries in `idx` will include `NA`s entries in the result, even if the original  vector `v` did not involve `NA`s.

In the example above, the result is:

```{r}
v[ idx ]
```

A logical vector like `idx` is typically a result of equality/comparison, or is generated by specialized functions. For example, if we wish to select entries in `v` that have values at least equal to 102 and smaller than 106, we could use:

```{r}
v
idx <- v >= 102
idx
v[ idx ]
```

We can also combine logical statements into a single one. Say, if we wish to select entries in `v` that have values at least equal to 102 and smaller than 106, we could use:

```{r}
v
idx <- (v >= 102) & (v < 106)
idx
v[ idx ]
```

Indices given by a logical vector are referred to as *logical indices*. 


```{r results="asis", echo=FALSE, comment=""}
catLinkTaskSection( "brackets", "02_selecting.Rmd" );
```

### Other useful functions  

Other functions which are in general useful are:

- `sort()`: sorts the elements of a vector:

```{r}
v
sort(v)
```

- `unique()`: returns a vector containing the unique entries of a vector:

```{r}
u <- c(5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 1)
unique(u)
w <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Monday", "Wednesday", "Thursday")
w
unique(w)
```

- `duplicated()`: returns a logical vector indicating which entries are duplicated or not:

```{r}
duplicated(u)
duplicated(w)
```

So, in order to select all duplicated entries, the following could be used:

```{r}
u[ duplicated(u) ]
```


```{r results="asis", echo=FALSE, comment=""}
catLinkTaskSection( "utility", "02_selecting.Rmd" );
```

## Data frames 

### What is a data frame

<center>![Vectors](figure/Data_types_mdfl.png)</center>

Data frame is a collection of variables represented as vectors of the same length.

Therefore, all the vectors (columns) should have unique names.

Rows represent separate records.

Rows might have names as well (although for new code, better create a separate column with names).

### Creating

#### From manually provided vectors

An example data frame built of `character`, `numeric` and `logical` vectors:

```{r}
ids <- c( "A", "B", "D", "E" );
ns <- c( "Amy", "Bob", "Dan", "Eve" )
as <- c( 40, NA, 6, 16 )
ss <- c( TRUE, NA, FALSE, FALSE )

d <- data.frame(
  row.names = ids,
  name = ns,
  age = as,
  smoker = ss
)
d
```

The class of `d` is:
```{r}
class( d )
```

Function `str` gives a compact display of an object structure/content:
```{r}
str( d )
```

#### Import from files

Datasets my come in various formats, e.g. `.tsv`, `.csv`, `.xls(x)`, `.sav`, `.txt` etc. R provides functions to import these formats as data.frame. 

_Note_: always after a file is read the columns must be checked whether their class and values are as expected. Additional conversions might be necessary (e.g. declaring factor levels, order of factor levels).

##### TSV file

For files stored in [tab-separated files (`tsv`) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) use:


```{r eval=FALSE}
d <- read.table( "data/pulse.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t" )
```


```{r result="as.is", echo=FALSE, comment="",eval=TRUE}
catReadTable( "pulse.tsv", "d" )
d <- read.table( "data/pulse.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t" )
```
```{r}
str( d )
```


##### CSV file

Data frames (tables) stored in files in [comma-separated values (`csv`) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) can be read with:
```{r eval=FALSE}
d <- read.csv( "data/pulse.csv" );
```

```{r result="as.is", echo=FALSE, comment="",eval=TRUE}
d <- catReadCsv( "pulse.csv", "d" )
```
```{r}
str( d )
```

##### (*) Microsoft Excel file

Reading Microsoft Excel files requires an additional library/package, which needs to be installed first. There exists several packages providing reading of Excel files.

###### (*) With package readxl

```{r eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
# install.packages( "readxl" )
library( readxl );
d <- read_excel( "data/pulse.xlsx", sheet = 1 );
str( d );
```
```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
# install.packages( "readxl" )
library( readxl )
d <- read_excel( "data/pulse.xlsx", sheet = 1 )
str( d )
```


###### (*) With package gdata

Please note that `gdata` package requires additional PERL packages to be installed; `readxl` seems to be easier to use.

```{r eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
# install.packages( "gdata" )
library( gdata )
d <- read.xls( "data/pulse.xlsx", sheet = 1 )
str( d )
```


#### (*) SPSS files

Reading SPSS files requires an additional library/package `foreign` (normally installed with R distribution). 

```{r eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
library( foreign )
d <- read.spss( "data/pulse.sav", to.data.frame = TRUE )
str( d )
```
```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library( foreign )
d <- read.spss( "data/pulse.sav", to.data.frame = TRUE );
str( d )
```




### Properties

Let's discuss the data frame `pulse`:
```{r eval=FALSE}
pulse <- read.table( "data/pulse.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t" )
```
```{r result="as.is", echo=FALSE, comment="",eval=TRUE}
pulse <- catReadTable( "pulse.txt", "pulse" )
```

To shorten output we will use the first 20 rows of the `pulse` data frame:
```{r}
pulse <- head( pulse, 20 )
```

#### Dimensions

There are several functions to get dimensions of a data frame:

- `ncol( pulse )` provides the number of columns:
```{r}
ncol( pulse )
```

- `nrow( pulse )` provides the number of rows:
```{r}
nrow( pulse )
```

- `dim( pulse )` returns a vector with two elements: number of rows and number of columns
```{r}
dim( pulse )
```

#### Columns/rows names

`colnames()` is used to get the names of the columns. In data frames, the same result is returned by `names()`:

```{r}
colnames( pulse )
names( pulse )
```

To get names of the rows use:

```{r}
rownames( pulse )
```



### Content

A column of a data frame might be accessed through the `$` operator.

Additionally, the content of a data frame can be accessed with the square bracket `[ ]` (square brackets) operator used in two different ways:

- with one argument `[ col(s) ]` referring to a column
- with two arguments `[ row(s), col(s) ]`

<!-- Note:  sometimes it is not obvious what is returned by those operators.
When a single column is requested, should it be:

- a vector with the column elements (so, a 1-dimensional structure)?
- a data frame with a single column (so, a 2-dimensional structure)? -->

We can illustrate this by creating a vector with the `height` variable of the `pulse` data, using both syntaxes:

```{r}
height1 <- pulse[ "height" ]
height2 <- pulse[, "height" ]
```

Now check the class of the objects created:

```{r}
class(height1) 
class(height2) 
```

So, by extracting one column of `pulse`using the syntax `[, columnName]`, a vector is created


#### Dollar operator

The `$` method returns a _single_ column as a _vector_:
```{r}
pulse$weight
```

When the column name is valid the returned value is a _vector_:
```{r}
class( pulse$weight )
```

When the name is invalid, `NULL` is returned:
```{r}
pulse$wrong
```

Be careful, the `$` notation searches for a column name starting with a provided prefix:
```{r}
pulse$we
```



#### Square brackets operator, single argument

Square brackets notation with a single argument return requested columns as a _data frame_ (compare to the dollar operator section):
```{r}
pulse[ 'weight' ]
class( pulse[ 'weight' ] )
```

```{r}
pulse[ 3 ]
class( pulse[ 3 ] )
```

Since the returned object is a `data.frame`, multiple columns might be returned (for example in a different order):
```{r}
pulse[ c( 'height', 'weight' ) ]
```

When a name is invalid, an error is produced:
```{r error=TRUE}
pulse[ 'wrong' ]
```

#### Square brackets operator, two arguments

Single brackets notation with two arguments `[ row(s), col(s) ]` might be used to get (multiple) row(s) and (multiple) column(s):
```{r}
pulse[ c( 1, 3 ), c( 'height', 'weight' ) ]
pulse[ c( "1993_C", "1993_A", "wrong" ), c( 'height', 'weight' ) ]
```

Warning: notice the difference of the class of the output when only a single column is requested:

```{r}
pulse[ , c( 'height', 'weight' ) ]
class( pulse[ , c( 'height', 'weight' ) ] )
```

```{r}
pulse[ , c( 'weight' ) ]
class( pulse[ , c( 'weight' ) ] )
```

Empty index field means "all" rows or columns:
```{r}
pulse[ , ]
pulse[ , c( 'height', 'weight' ) ]
pulse[ c( "1993_C", "1993_A" ), ]
```

```{r results="asis", echo=FALSE, comment=""}
catLinkTaskSection( "dataframes", "03_data_frames.Rmd" );
```



## Matrices

### What is a matrix

<center>![Vectors](figure/Data_types_mdfl.png)</center>

Matrix is a two-dimensional array of elements of the same type.

Rows and columns are addressed by numerical indices.

Rows and columns might also get names. The names might be used for indexing.

### Creation

A matrix can be constructed from a vector. Depending on the arguments, elements are put to the matrix in a different order:

```{r}
m <- matrix( 1:6, nrow = 2 );
m
m <- matrix( 1:6, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE );
m
m <- matrix( 1:6, ncol = 2 );
m
```

The class of `m` is:
```{r}
class( m )
```

Function `str` gives a compact display of an object structure/content:
```{r}
str( m )
```

### Dimensions

There are several functions to get dimensions of a matrix:

- `ncol( m )` provides the number of columns:
```{r}
ncol( m )
```

- `nrow( m )` provides the number of rows:
```{r}
nrow( m )
```

- `dim( m )` returns a vector with two elements: number of rows and number of columns
```{r}
dim( m )
```

### Setting/getting names of the columns and rows

`colnames( m )` and `rownames( m )` are used to set and get the names of matrix columns and rows:
```{r}
m
colnames( m ) <- c( "A", "B" )
m
rownames( m ) <- c( "X", "Y", "Z" )
m
```

To get names use:
```{r}
rownames( m )
colnames( m )
```

### Getting matrix elements

Single brackets notation with two arguments `[ row(s), col(s) ]` might be used to get specified row(s) and column(s). By default single rows/cols will get reduced to a vector.

```{r}
m[ 3, 1 ]
m[ c( 2, 3 ), 1 ]
m[ c( 2, 3 ), c( "B", "A" ) ]
m[ c( F, T, T ), c( "B", "A" ) ]
```

Notice the difference in the output class when only a single element is requested:
```{r}
class( m[ 3, 1 ] )
class( m[ c( 2, 3 ), c( "B", "A" ) ] )
```

Dropping of `matrix` dimensionality might be prevented:
```{r}
m[ 3, 1 ]
m[ 3, 1, drop = FALSE ]
class( m[ 3, 1, drop = FALSE ] )
```

Empty index field means "all" rows or columns:
```{r}
m[ , c( "B", "A" ) ]
m[ c( "Z", "X", "Y" ), ]
m[ , ]
```

### Useful matrix functions

Short summary of matrix operations: http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/matrix.html

#### Row/columns means/sums

```{r}
m
rowMeans( m )
rowSums( m )
colMeans( m )
colSums( m )
```


####  (*) Transposition

```{r}
m <- matrix( 1:6, nrow = 3 );
colnames( m ) <- c( "A", "B" )
rownames( m ) <- c( "X", "Y", "Z" )
m
t(m)
```

####  (*) Matrix multiplication

```{r}
m
t( m )
m %*% t( m )
```

####  (*) Element-wise multiplication

```{r}
m
m+1
m * (m+1)
```


```{r results="asis", echo=FALSE, comment=""}
