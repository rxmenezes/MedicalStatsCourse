# Create a new RMarkdown file

- add the name of two people as authors

- name the first section "Introduction", and write some text in it.

- load the `survey.txt` data and display the variable names contained in it within a code chunk

- write in the text how many rows and columns the file contains. *Hint:* Use `nrow()` and `ncol()` within in-line code.

- add to the text the URL where the file can be downloaded.
