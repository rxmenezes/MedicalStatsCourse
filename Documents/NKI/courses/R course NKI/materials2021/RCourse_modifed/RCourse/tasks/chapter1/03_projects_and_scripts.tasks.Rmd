# Loading data from txt {#firstLoad}

For the quick exercises we will mostly work with the `survey` data. Let's load them into R.

- Download in `survey.txt` into your data folder

- Load this new data set into R and call it survey

```{r eval=1, echo=2}
survey <- read.delim("../data/survey.txt")
survey <- read.delim("data/survey.txt")
```

- View it
```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(survey)
```

# Making a script {#firstScript}

We will make a script to read in the pulse and survey data. We'll use that every day in the course.

- Start a new script that reads the pulse and survey data sets
- Add a comment to the script
- Save the script under a useful name
- Check it by closing and opening RStudio and running the script (HINT: make sure you are in the right project)
